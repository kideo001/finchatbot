This is the readme file for FinChatBot assessment.

This demo caters for the following.

1. Two types of questions, anything asked arround the word "balance" in terms of enquiring the monatary amount.
2. Anything asked around the word "loan" in terms of applying for one
3. It also does various greetings in English, Afrikans and Sotho. Key words looked for are hi, hello, ola, dumelang, goeie dag

Basic layout of code.

   -config
   -intercept
   -services
   -utils
   -views
   -server.ts

Breakdown of design.

A functional approach was followed in the coding of this.
Intercepts are used to do common checks and handle common errors.
Services and routes are handled in the same way using NodeJS express decoupled from functional code with controllers. Technicaly models could also have been used for database access
Views were done with Jade / JQuery / CSS3
The main entry point for this application is the server.ts file.

PM2 was used to do process management of the Node components. The alternative is kubernetes but that isn't an option for this assessment.
Docker used to build docker image

Swagger was used to document API endpoints and is available at /api-docs/
command to build.
  docker build -t kideo/finchatbot:latest -f Dockerfile .

Command to run
  docker run -p3000:3000 kideo/finchatbot



Server listens on port 3000 internally.


Thanks
